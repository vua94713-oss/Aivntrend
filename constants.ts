    prompt: "Create a Polaroid-style photo of a couple. The photo should have a nostalgic, slightly blurred look with a direct flash effect as if taken in a dimly lit room. Do not alter their faces. The background should be a simple white curtain. The man is playfully poking the woman's cheek, and she is smiling with her eyes closed. Both are expressing genuine joy and affection."

    prompt: "Use the nano-banana model to create a 1/7 scale commercialized figure of the character in the illustration, in a realistic style and environment. Place the figure on a computer desk, using a circular transparent acrylic base without any text. On the computer screen, display the ZBrush modeling process of the figure. Next to the computer screen, place a BANDAI-style toy packaging box printed with the original artwork."

    prompt: "Use the provided photo as the reference image. Restore and inpaint only the damaged/missing areas while preserving the original face, pose and expression. Remove all stains, peeling paper, scratches, cracks and dirt; reconstruct missing facial features and clothing realistically and consistently with the reference. Restore natural, realistic colorization (warm neutral skin tones, natural black/dark-brown hair) while keeping a subtle vintage film look if necessary. Preserve original lighting, shadows and grain; reconstruct fine details (eyes, eyelashes, hair strands, lips, collar seam, texture of fabric). Keep identity and proportions exactly — do NOT change age, expression, face shape or add accessories (no glasses, jewelry, modern props). Recreate a plain neutral background matching the original tone.\nFinal output: photorealistic, high-detail restoration suitable for printing. Output resolution: 3840×2160 (4K) — if that is not available, 1920×1080 (Full HD). Use the image as the primary guide and only fill masked damaged areas."
